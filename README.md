# Implementing Vector Search in PostgreSQL with Azure OpenAI

This repo is about exploring vector search, an advanced information retrieval method using numerical representations to optimize large dataset searches.

Vector search surpasses traditional methods by leveraging vector similarity to find semantic relationships. Widely used in natural language processing and machine learning, it enhances personalized recommendations, data analysis, and search engine optimization.

We will implement vector search in PostgreSQL using the pgvector extension and create embeddings with Azure OpenAI's embedding-ada-002 model, demonstrating how to integrate these powerful tools into your applications.
